# Step 1: Install Nginx (if not already installed)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx -y

# Step 2: (Optional) No specific configuration step is added here as by default,
# Nginx listens on port 80. If there's a custom configuration, it can be added here.

# Step 3: Ensure Nginx is running
sudo systemctl enable nginx  # Enable Nginx to start on boot
sudo systemctl start nginx   # Start Nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx # Restart Nginx to apply any changes (safe if it's already running)

# Optional: Confirm that Nginx is listening on port 80
netstat -tuln | grep ':80'
